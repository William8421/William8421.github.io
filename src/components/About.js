          English-Arabic language pairs. Over the course of four enriching years, I contributed my linguistic expertise
          to the worlds of video games and movies localization, and magazine article translation.

          perspective and a versatile skill set. With a dedication to creating captivating digital solutions,
          I'm eager to continue my journey of innovation and growth in the dynamic realm of web development.
